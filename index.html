<h2 class="section">2023 NFL Draft Prospects Visualization</h2>
With the 2023 NFL Draft Combine (an annual week-long showcase where draft prospects perform physical and skill tests) having just been completed, NFL teams are beginning to finalize what players they are most interested
in drafting from April 27 - April 29. Many NFL fans have been discussing amongst themselves about which players fit their favorite team the best
and what positions their favorite team should address during the NFL Draft. To understand the characteristics of each draft prospect,
I have created some visualizations that answer questions about which players were the quickest at the Combine, where players are coming from, and which players
might have the most chemistry together if they were to be drafted by the same team.

<h3>Is There a Difference in the 3-cone Drill and the Shuttle Drill?</h3>
At the NFL Combine, there are two physical drills that prospects can participate in that test the player's agility: the 3-cone drill and the 20-yard shuttle.
The difference between the two drills is that the shuttle drill tests a player's ability to change speeds and accelerate to their top speed, which the 3-cone drill doesn't do.
However, many fans and pundits have argued that both drills are somewhat redundant as they both test a player's change of direction and stop-start abilities.
The scatter plot below compares a player's time in both of these drills.

As shown in the graph above, players who did well in one drill also did well in the other drill, 
while doing poor in one drill also meant you were likely to have done poorly in the other drill.
Given that there were some players who participated in only of of the two drills, you could potentially
predict the approximate time that player would have gotten in the drill that they skipped. Also, since there does
seem to be a positive correlation between the two drills, you could also only use one drill to determine a player's agility.

<h3>Which Wide Receivers are the Quickest in this Draft Class?</h3>
On the topic of agility, wide receivers need to be both agile and fast to create separation between them and the opposing
defenders. While these attributes might not necessarily be the only skills that are important at the position, many teams tend to covet
wide receivers who possess speed and agility. Below is a stacked bar chart that displays the fastest and most agile wide receivers in this 
year's draft class, using the 40-yard dash to represent speed and the 3-cone time and shuttle time being used to represent agility.

<br>
The stacked bar chart above shows that of the wide receivers who participated in all 3 of the speed and
agility drills, the player with the best blend of speed and agility was Andrei Iosivas, while the player
who did the worst in the combination of the three drills was Michael Jefferson.

<h3>Which Conferences do Most 2023 NFL Draft Prospects Come From?</h3>
Many college football fans will claim that the best, most competitive conference is whichever conference
their favorite college team plays in. This debate has bled over into the NFL draft process, where many NFL fans
wonder which players play in the most competitive conferences, as it can help show how good a player is if they can
stand out amongst a group of the best players or help show how dominating in a weaker conference might not translate to
the NFL level. To show which conference might be best conference, I have created a bar chart that represents the conferences
that most NFL draft prospects come from (minimum 5 prospects from each conference).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div id="plot3">

    <div id="bar_chart" class="center_plot">

<br>
<br>
From the above bar chart, it is clear that the SEC has produced more 2023 draft prospects compared to any other conference.
This isn't surprising when you consider how successful many of the SEC schools have been in the College Football Playoffs,
with LSU, Alabama, and Georgia (x2) winning the last 4 National Championships. The conference with the second most number of 
NFL draft prospects in 2023 is the Big Ten, followed by the ACC and the Big 12.

    <br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    - Channels: Position (Horizontal & Vertical), Size (Area)
    <br>
    <br>
</div>
</div>   

<div>
<h3>Which States Produced the Most 2023 NFL Draft Prospects?</h3>
Having seen that many NFL draft prospects come from the SEC, which is a conference located in the southeastern part of the United States,
it is also important to note that conferences aren't geographically locked, meaning that not all schools from the same conference are in the same
area. This means that some states may produce significantly more NFL draft prospects than other states, but since there can be multiple conferences
within the same state, the number of 2023 draft prospects in that state were spread amongst the multiple conferences. To counter this, I've created
a choropleth that visualizes the number of 2023 NFL Draft prospects that come from each state in the United States.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div id="plot4">
    </div>
    <div id="choropleth" class="center_plot">
    </div>
</div> 
</div>    
<br>
Interestingly, the choropleth above shows that the state that has the most number of 2023 NFL draft prospects is Texas, 
despite the SEC only having one school based in Texas (Texas A&M). This is probably because many of the other major colleges
in Texas are in other conferences, like the Big 12 (Baylor, TCU, Texas Tech, and Texas).
<br>
<br>
Another fascinating observation from the map is that a majority of the prospects in this year's class comes from a school on the
east coast, whereas only 3 states on the west coast produced a significant number of prospects in this draft class.

    <h3>Which 2023 NFL Draft Defensive Prospects will have the Most Chemistry with Each Other?</h3>
    In football, having good defensive players isn't the only thing that makes a great defense. It is arguably more important for defensive
    players to have great chemistry, as if one player slips up, the opposing offense can take advantage of it and change the 
    balance of the game in their favor. Finding out which defensive players in this draft class that'll have the most chemistry is difficult,
    but using a player's position, school, and state can help determine who they are more likely to have better chemistry with in the NFL.
    <br><br>
    To define a player's chemistry with another player, we use the following point values if the players have the same matching attributes:
    <br><br><br>
    <table class="tables">
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Point(s)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Same Position</td>
            <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Same School</td>
            <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Same Position Group*</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Same State</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <br>
    <br>
    *  = 3 Position Groups: Defensive Linemen (DE, DT), Linebackers (LB, EDGE), and Defensive Backs (SAF, CB)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Given these point values, I've created an adjacency matrix to visualize the chemistry between defensive prospects in this year's NFL draft.
    From our earlier bar chart, we found that the SEC is the best conference at producing NFL draft prospects, and so the adjacency matrix will include
    only SEC prospects.
    <div id="plot5">
        </div>
        <div id="adjacency_matrix" class="center_plot">
        </div>
    </div> 
    </div>    
    <br>
    <br>
    The adjacency matrix shows players with higher chemistry values with a darker green color in the cell.
    Besides for the main diagonal, which has pairs of the same player twice, there are 9 pairs of players with 
    perfect chemistry, according to our model. NFL teams who are looking to draft multiple defensive players in the draft should look at these pairs
    if they want to have a more cohesive defensive unit immediately. Simultaneously, drafting defensive players who have a lighter shade of green 
    in their shared cell will likely mean that the two players will take longer to familiarize themselves together.
